  <figcaption class="bet">It is necessary to keep our beaches clean if we hope to keep our oceans clean. The sand and 
    surf is far more than a place to build sand castles and take a dive. Beaches are home to various 
    creatures from sea lions to sea turtles. Many animals depend on land to survive. Land that is 
    untainted by chemical wastes or human wastes. Marine life, dwelling only in the water, are also 
    affected by waste on beaches. When the tides rise, they collect items on the beach and take the 
    items out when the water lowers, including trash. This can have negative effects on marine life. 
    Corrine Henn found that trash and plastic pollution affect 100 million marine mammals each year. 
    Animals do not know that a shiny candy wrapper is not meant to be eaten. It can easily be mistaken 
    as a fish or piece of kelp. There are ways to prevent this from 
     happening to our ocean creatures. By keeping this environment trash free we help protect and 
     preserve marine life.Cuaderno,program to tackle the ocean litter issue â€“ primarily caused by plastic pollution - through education for action, citizen science, and campaigns. 
     We are all part of the solution and together we can restore our coastlines, one beach at a time.
